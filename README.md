## Usage
To use the Web App MQTT Broker Connect, you need to install it on a server and access the corresponding URL. The application has been tested with Apache2 on Ubuntu, but it should work with other web servers as well.
1. Clone the repository to your server.
```
git clone https://github.com/j03rul4nd/uix-mqtt.git
```
2. Install Apache2 and PHP on your server if they are not already installed.
3. Copy the contents of the repository to your Apache2 document root (typically /var/www/html/).
```
sudo cp -r uix-mqtt/* /var/www/html/
```
4. Open a web browser and navigate to your server's IP address or hostname.
